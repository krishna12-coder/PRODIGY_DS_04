import numpy as np:

numpy is a powerful numerical computing library in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.
import numpy as np imports the numpy library and uses the alias np, which is a common convention to refer to numpy functions and objects easily in the code.
import pandas as pd:

pandas is a widely-used data manipulation library in Python. It offers data structures like DataFrame and Series, allowing for easy handling, manipulation, and analysis of structured data.
import pandas as pd imports the pandas library and uses the alias pd, making it simpler to reference pandas functions and objects in the code.

The .dtypes attribute in Pandas is used to display the data types of each column in a DataFrame (df). It provides information about how Pandas has interpreted and stored the data within the DataFrame columns.

When you call df.dtypes, it returns a Series object where the index represents the column names, and the values represent the data types of those columns.

['Date', 'AveragePrice', 'Total Volume', '4046', '4225', '4770', 'Total Bags', 'type', 'region']: This is a list of column names. It represents the columns you want to keep in the DataFrame df and their order.

df[['Date', 'AveragePrice', 'Total Volume', '4046', '4225', '4770', 'Total Bags', 'type', 'region']]: This part of the code uses the list of column names to select and reorder columns in the DataFrame df.

Convert 'AveragePrice' column to numeric:


df['AveragePrice'] = pd.to_numeric(df['AveragePrice'], errors='coerce')
pd.to_numeric() from Pandas is used to convert the values in the 'AveragePrice' column to numeric data type.
errors='coerce' parameter tells Pandas to replace non-convertible elements (e.g., strings that can't be converted to numbers) with NaN (Not a Number).
Drop rows with NaN values in 'AveragePrice' column:


df.dropna(subset=['AveragePrice'], inplace=True)
dropna() is a Pandas function used to remove rows with missing values (NaN).
subset=['AveragePrice'] specifies that the operation should be performed only on the 'AveragePrice' column.
inplace=True modifies the DataFrame df in place, meaning the changes are applied to the DataFrame itself.
Print unique values of 'AveragePrice' column:


print(df['AveragePrice'].unique())
df['AveragePrice'].unique() returns an array of unique values present in the 'AveragePrice' column after the transformations.
print() displays these unique values in the output.


Importing the re module:


import re
This line imports the re module, which provides support for working with regular expressions in Python.
Filtering rows based on 'AveragePrice' column with valid numeric values using regex:


numeric_df = df[df['AveragePrice'].apply(lambda x: bool(re.match(r'^-?\d+(?:\.\d+)?$', str(x))))]
df['AveragePrice'].apply(lambda x: bool(re.match(r'^-?\d+(?:\.\d+)?$', str(x)))) applies a lambda function to each value in the 'AveragePrice' column using apply.
re.match(r'^-?\d+(?:\.\d+)?$', str(x)) checks if the string value x matches the specified regex pattern:
r'^-?\d+(?:\.\d+)?$' matches numeric values with an optional decimal point.
bool() converts the match result into a boolean value.
The result of this expression is a boolean mask indicating rows where the 'AveragePrice' column contains valid numeric values based on the regex pattern.
df[...] filters the DataFrame df using this boolean mask to select rows where the 'AveragePrice' column matches the regex pattern. This filtered DataFrame is stored in numeric_df.
Converting 'AveragePrice' column in numeric_df to numeric data type:


numeric_df['AveragePrice'] = pd.to_numeric(numeric_df['AveragePrice'])
This line converts the 'AveragePrice' column in the numeric_df DataFrame to numeric data type using pd.to_numeric() from Pandas.
Explanation for df[['AveragePrice', 'Total Volume']]:


df[['AveragePrice', 'Total Volume']]
This code snippet retrieves the columns 'AveragePrice' and 'Total Volume' from the DataFrame df and displays them.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt and import seaborn as sns:

These lines import the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization.
df.hist():

df is a Pandas DataFrame.
.hist() is a Pandas DataFrame method used for creating histograms.
When called on a DataFrame like df.hist(), it generates histograms for all the numerical columns in that DataFrame.
Explanation:

For each numerical column in the DataFrame df, df.hist() creates a separate histogram.
The histograms showcase the distribution of values within each numerical column. They visualize how the values are spread across different bins or intervals.
By default, these histograms are displayed in separate subplots, with each subplot representing a numerical column.
Matplotlib is used to render these histograms, and Seaborn may enhance their appearance by applying certain styles or themes, although in this case, the specific usage of Seaborn is not explicitly evident.

Setting the Figure Size:

plt.figure(figsize=(14,10))
plt.figure(figsize=(14,10)) sets the size of the upcoming plot to be 14 units wide and 10 units tall using Matplotlib.
Creating the Scatter Plot:


sns.scatterplot(x='Total Volume', y='AveragePrice', hue='type', data=df)
sns.scatterplot() is a Seaborn function for generating a scatter plot.
x='Total Volume' specifies that the 'Total Volume' column will be plotted on the x-axis.
y='AveragePrice' specifies that the 'AveragePrice' column will be plotted on the y-axis.
hue='type' adds color differentiation to the scatter plot based on the values in the 'type' column. Each unique value in the 'type' column will be represented by a different color.
data=df indicates that the data to be plotted comes from the DataFrame df.
Explanation:

This code creates a scatter plot where each point represents a data entry.
The x-axis represents the 'Total Volume', the y-axis represents the 'AveragePrice', and different colors represent different types of data points based on the 'type' column in the DataFrame.
It helps visualize the relationship (if any) between the 'Total Volume' and 'AveragePrice' columns, while also showing how the 'type' column affects this relationship by assigning different colors to different types.

Setting the Figure Size and Title:


plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.title('Price of avocado')
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6)) sets the size of the upcoming plot to be 10 units wide and 6 units tall using Matplotlib.
plt.title('Price of avocado') sets the title of the plot to 'Price of avocado'.
Creating the Boxplot:


sns.boxplot(x='type', y='AveragePrice', data=df, color='skyblue')
sns.boxplot() is a Seaborn function for generating a boxplot.
x='type' specifies that the 'type' column will be represented on the x-axis and used for categorizing the data.
y='AveragePrice' specifies that the 'AveragePrice' column will be represented on the y-axis.
data=df indicates that the data to be plotted comes from the DataFrame df.
color='skyblue' sets the color of the boxes in the boxplot to 'skyblue'.
Explanation:

This code generates a boxplot that displays the distribution of 'AveragePrice' for different types of avocados ('type').
The x-axis shows the different types of avocados ('conventional' and 'organic' types in this case), and the y-axis represents the 'AveragePrice'.
Boxplots are useful for visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable ('AveragePrice') within different categories ('type' of avocado) and for identifying any differences or outliers in the data distribution between these categories.


Setting up the Figure:

plt.figure(figsize=(11, 6))
plt.title('Price of avocado in each country')
plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
plt.figure(figsize=(11, 6)) sets the size of the plot to be 11 units wide and 6 units tall using Matplotlib.
plt.title('Price of avocado in each country') sets the title of the plot.
plt.xticks(rotation='vertical') rotates the x-axis labels vertically for better readability when dealing with potentially long country names.
Defining the Color Palette:


my_palette = "husl"
my_palette = "husl" defines a color palette to be used in the boxplot. Here, 'husl' is a qualitative colormap that provides distinct colors, suitable for categorical data.
Creating the Boxplot:


sns.boxplot(x='region', y='AveragePrice', data=df, width=1, whis=2, palette=my_palette)
sns.boxplot() from Seaborn is used to generate the boxplot.
x='region' specifies that the 'region' column will be represented on the x-axis, categorizing the data by country.
y='AveragePrice' specifies that the 'AveragePrice' column will be represented on the y-axis.
data=df indicates that the data to be plotted comes from the DataFrame df.
width=1 sets the width of the boxes in the boxplot.
whis=2 sets the length of the whiskers in the boxplot.
palette=my_palette specifies the color palette to be used for coloring the boxes.
Explanation:

This code generates a boxplot where each box represents the distribution of 'AveragePrice' for avocados across different countries (regions).
The x-axis displays the countries (regions), and the y-axis represents the 'AveragePrice'.
The boxes in the plot depict the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the price distribution of avocados for each country, allowing for easy comparison of avocado prices across different regions.


Setting up the Figure:


plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)) sets the size of the plot to be 8 units wide and 6 units tall using Matplotlib.
Creating the Scatter Plot:


plt.scatter(df['Total Volume'], df['AveragePrice'], color='yellow')
plt.scatter() is a Matplotlib function used to create a scatter plot.
df['Total Volume'] represents the x-axis values (Total Volume).
df['AveragePrice'] represents the y-axis values (Average Price).
color='yellow' specifies the color of the scatter points as yellow.
Setting Labels and Title:


plt.xlabel('Total Volume')
plt.ylabel('Average Price')
plt.title('Total Volume vs. Average Price')
plt.xlabel() sets the label for the x-axis.
plt.ylabel() sets the label for the y-axis.
plt.title() sets the title for the plot.
Explanation:

This code generates a scatter plot where each point represents an observation in the dataset, with 'Total Volume' on the x-axis and 'AveragePrice' on the y-axis.
The plot visualizes the relationship between the total volume of avocados and their average price.
Scatter plots are useful for observing patterns or trends between two continuous variables, in this case, understanding how the average price of avocados varies concerning their total volume.
